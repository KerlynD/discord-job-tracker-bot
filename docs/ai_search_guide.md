# AI-Powered Search Feature Guide

## Overview

The `/search` command uses Google's Gemini AI to let you query your job application data using natural language. Instead of learning specific filters and commands, you can ask questions like you would to a human assistant.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test Installation
```bash
python scripts/test_gemini.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
- `/search How many applications do I have?`
- `/search Which companies rejected me?`
- `/search What's my success rate?`

### Company-Specific Queries
- `/search How many Bloomberg interviews am I in?`
- `/search What stage am I at with Google?`
- `/search Which companies ghosted me?`

### Time-Based Analysis
- `/search How many applications did I submit this month?`
- `/search What's my most active season?`
- `/search Which applications are getting old?`

### Stage Analysis
- `/search How many people are in onsite interviews?`
- `/search What percentage of my applications reach the phone stage?`
- `/search How many offers do I have?`

### Advanced Insights
- `/search What's my conversion rate from OA to phone?`
- `/search Which season has the highest success rate?`
- `/search What companies should I follow up with?`

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection for AI processing
- API calls cost money (minimal for personal use)
- Cannot modify data, only query it
- Limited to data in your job tracker database

## Troubleshooting

### "AI search is not available"
- Check that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Verify the API key is valid
- Run `python scripts/test_gemini.py` to diagnose

### "Query contains potentially harmful keyword"
- Rephrase your question to avoid SQL-like keywords
- Use natural language instead of technical terms

### Unexpected or incorrect responses
- Be more specific in your question
- Check that your application data is correct
- Try rephrasing the query

## Cost Considerations

- Gemini API pricing is very affordable for personal use
- Each query costs fractions of a penny
- Consider setting up billing alerts if concerned

## Privacy Notes

- Only your application metadata is sent to Google's API
- No personal information like emails or addresses
- Data is used only for generating your response
- Consider this when deciding to use the feature
